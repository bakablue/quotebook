# Quotebook

This project is currently in progress and is based on the idea of http://epiquote.fr/ and http://bakablue.fr/bakaquote.php.

The aim of this application is to :
  * Add and list/share quotes between friends
  * Vote for the worst and best ones

You must be identified to be able to add and vote for quotes.

Eventually, there could be a mobile application and a way to set it up for a group of friend (with the help of a group password added by an admin).
